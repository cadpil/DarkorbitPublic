Optimal mass is the mass at which the thrusters are designed for. Having less mass than optimal 
will result in better ship handling (higher speeds, better turning etc.). Having more mass than optimal
will result in worse ship handling (lower speeds, worse turning etc.). If a ship's mass exceeds it's thruster's 
maximum mass, the ship will not be able to move. When a ship's mass is equal to the thruster's optimal mass,
the ship will have a maximum speed of the 'OptimalMassSpeed' of the thrusters. As the ship gets heavier, the
maximum speed of the ship will decrease all the way to 0 (0 will only be reached if the ship's mass is equal
to or greater than the ship's maximum mass). As the ship gets lighter, the maximum speed of the ship will increase
up to 50% more than the thruster's 'OptimalMassSpeed'. The same applies for acceleration.
